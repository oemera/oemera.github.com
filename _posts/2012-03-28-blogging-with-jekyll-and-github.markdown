I am a developer, therefore I should have a blog. Right? I've been planning on setting one up for a while, but I didn't want to use Wordpress and was having trouble trying to figure out another solution without having to write one from scratch. Don't get me wrong, Wordpress does work well for blogs, but as a developer it just felt dirty to use that for my personal site where I should be showing off my mad skillz. Wordpress site != Mad Skillz. I figure it's kind of like a good carpenter buying all his wood furniture from Ikea. It's easy and works, but you can't be very proud to have it in your house.

I was also looking for something that I can use a very simple and clean layout for without too much trouble. Yes, Wordpress has lots of themes, but a lot of them are bloated, or are a pain in the ass to modify the templates unless you understand the Wordpress template system, I don't care about learning that. I like a lot of Tumblr sites that I've seen, but I hate not owning my data. I follow Zach Holman on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/holman) and read [his blog](http://www.zachholman.com), he's a smart developer at [GitHub](http://www.github.com) who has some interesting opinions and ideas, and he's actually pretty entertaining. I decided that I like the simplicity of his blog, and since he's a cool developer he must have created his blog in a cool way!? He did.

## Github Pages and Jekyll

There are a lot of people using Github for Git repository hosting, but did you know that your Github account also includes basic webhosting? Not only is it free, but it's automatically source controlled, and if you can push to a git repository, you can deploy your Github Pages. All you have to do is create a new repository called: *username.github.com*. If you are already familiar with HTML and Git, some of this will be pretty basic, so you can skip down a bit to find the good stuff.
